## Core Requirements

1. **Instance Context**
   - Instance URL and environment (dev, test, prod)
   - Instance version and patch level
   - Custom applications and scopes
   - Instance-specific configurations

2. **Development Workflow**
   - Story/Spike tracking
   - Implementation patterns
   - Testing requirements
   - Deployment procedures

3. **Technical Standards**

   - Custom coding standards
   - Performance considerations
   - Security requirements

## Project Goals

1. Enable Cursor AI to maintain context between sessions
2. Provide ServiceNow-specific implementation guidance
3. Track technical decisions and patterns
4. Maintain documentation of instance configurations
5. Support Agile development workflow

## Success Criteria
